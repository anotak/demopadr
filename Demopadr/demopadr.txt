Description             : demopadr.exe is a tool by anotak for padding demos
                          for vanilla compatibility during the demo reel when
                          you start doom. this is due to the revenant tracer
                          desync issue.
                          for more information see the DoomWiki article
                          "Revenant tracers desync internal demos".
                          
                          demopadr is a commandline tool that runs on demo
                          lmp files.
                          correct usage is:
                          
                                demopadr <input> <output>
                          
                          for this to work, all 3 demos in a wad must be
                          padded. otherwise demos with revenants may still
                          desync on vanilla/choco doom.
                          
                          demopadr.exe requires .NET 3.5 or Mono. 3.5 is
                          included in Windows 7 or above. If you're on
                          Linux or OSX, it should work with Mono.
